# Project objectives: 
#   Read temperature and humidity values from the DHT22 sensor
#   Display the sensor readings in the console
#
# Hardware connections used:
#   DHT22 VCC Pin to 3.3V
#   DHT22 SDA Pin to GPIO Pin 15
#   10k ohm pull-up resistor from DHT22 SDA Pin to 3.3V (diregard if DHT22 is 3-pin)
#   DHT22 GND Pin to GND
#
# Programmer: Adrian Josele G. Quional
